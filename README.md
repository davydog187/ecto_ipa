# Ecto IPA

This is a project to demonstrate the capabilities of Ecto from a beginners perspective. Check out the notes for my talk [here](https://github.com/davydog187/ecto_ipa/blob/master/talk.md)


## Development

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
